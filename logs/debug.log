You can disable all deprecation warnings by setting `Error.errorLevel` to `E_ALL & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED`. Adding `src/Model/Table/UsersTable.php` to `Error.ignoredDeprecationPaths` in your `config/app.php` config will mute deprecations from that file only.

You can disable all deprecation warnings by setting `Error.errorLevel` to `E_ALL & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED`. Adding `vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Database/Connection.php` to `Error.ignoredDeprecationPaths` in your `config/app.php` config will mute deprecations from that file only.
